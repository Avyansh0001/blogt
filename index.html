      <h2>How did I fgure out the name Airbus?</h2>
      <p>I had a company called Airbuy which was my first company used which was a typing test forum... So basically. <a href="http://airdown.glitch.me/">Airdown</a>, is the only reason why Airbus is still even here!!!</p>
      <h2>What it took me to make this?</h2>
      <p>So basically, I found out the basic template for the person which will look both elegant and stylish...</p>
      <p>I used "Sublime Text" as my main IDE and used "Freepik" for UI/UX designs, logos and business cards!</p>
      <h2>What frameworks did I use?</h2>
